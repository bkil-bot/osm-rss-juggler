        <title>News from the machine room: the pure #rust end-to-end encryption engine, &amp;quot;rpgp&amp;quot;, saw quite some work and a new release in recent weeks and now @hko released a higher level &amp;quot;rpgpie&amp;quot; interface for application developers ( see https://fosstodon.org/@hko/111997998005869515 ) which also powers running the IETF #OpenPGP #interoperability test suite quite successfully .... Delta Chat&amp;#39;s security-audited encryption engine is in fact used from several other projects and in other contexts these days and we are happy about it!</title>

        <title>In whichever area of #deltachat related developments you look, you will find different people and communities -- even if there are several individuals who appear in multiple contexts as key contributors or drivers. There is no single person who gets to decide about everything even if we do have lead roles for particular aspects. Our experimental community approaches respect Convays Law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law -- meaning: our #decentralization tech will be only as good as our social practises</title>

        <title>Was an eventful and enjoyable #offdem24 and #fossdem24 .... Ranging from intermingling with people operating security-sensitiv helplines using #chatmail to discussing email standards like the evolving openpgp cryptorefresh ... And then several more underground happenings which might lead to even more surprises than are already developing .... with many of us agreeing and appreciating that we are rather engaged with lots interesting communities and folks rather than corporate structures.</title>

        <title>When you are interacting with this account here you are actually interacting with a bunch of folks involved in various ways in project happenings, who are often following interactions via a deltachat mastodon bot that relays messages into a chat group from where the reply is triggered. Many of the @delta members have an #offlinefirst approach to networking so mostly use the chat group to interact. #DidYouKnowDepartment</title>

        <title>Not only are we user-testing app release candidates with various groups ahead of putting it to stores (thanks to the many helpers from across the globe!) but we are also intertwining design decisions with early user-testing with actual groups in risk (big shoutout to @Xeniax !) -- see here for an example which showcases that the question on which &amp;quot;attacker&amp;quot; to focus on is a fundamental question and you can not meaningfully discuss &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; without it. https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/pull/2916#issuecomment-1883086981</title>

        <title>The #37c3 delta chat group size is now at 67 members ... Still no glitches except a bit of confusion with someone switching from one account to another and then another :) You can indeed #migrate from a https://nine.testrun.org account to another email address and keep all your guaranteed encrypted chats ....Other will notice and autoaccept your mail adress change ... See https://delta.chat/en/2022-09-14-aeap for how this works. #RightToExit #RightToMigrate</title>

        <title>The #37c3 delta chat group has now 48 members, all using guaranteed end to end encryption and several games and apps .... So far without a glitch, no &amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t decrypt&amp;quot; errors, everything lightning fast, some people using multiple devices with their account, 30 people joining during live onboarding on day1 and using a editor together in the chat (like cryptpad without a server basically). Seems like all the milestones of 2023 (guaranteed e2ee, web apps, chatmail) are ... Actually playing out ;)</title>

        <title>More #deltachat folks are arriving at #37c3 today and tomorrow .... We I&amp;#39;ll be around #komona in hall H ... On day 1 we intend to do a #chatmail hands on session probably in the evening. There is usually a #komona billboard with planned sessions .... Anyways, everyone, please have enjoyable travels and a wonderful (as can be these days, for some it&amp;#39;s gruesome) beginnings of 2024 ... See you at 37c3 or elsewhere!</title>

        <title>#chatmail is not a replacement for Whatsapp in the traditional sense. It&amp;#39;s a small machine that can be tweaked in many ways. The tweakability of the e-mail system is in it&amp;#39;s DNA and practises ... that is the antithesis to WA if you like :) What drives nine.testrun.org, the first public chatmail service, is fully visible at https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail -- a minimalist config and setup, some python modules and tests, standard postfix/dovecot. co-incidentally pretty fast but there is a twist ;) Delta Chat messaging screen with echo-bot: One said says &quot;Hi&quot;, the bot answers &quot;Hi&quot;. One sight says &quot;Oh!&quot; and 0.24 seconds later the bot says &quot;Oh!&quot; One says &quot;That was fast&quot; and the bot answers. All 6 messages were typed, received and seen in 4.16 seconds overall.</title>

        <title>Today, we are unveiling chatmail services, making onboarding with #deltachat a breeze, with peace of mind. #chatmail marks a major milestone, answering the practical question of &amp;quot;where can i get a deltachat-ready account&amp;quot; for myself and friends?

        <title>Seems google/apple&amp;#39;s push notifications services are regularly queried by state authorities for obtaining user data -- see this german @netzpolitik_feed https://netzpolitik.org/2023/push-dienste-behoerden-fragen-apple-und-google-nach-nutzern-von-messenger-apps/ -- #deltachat only uses apple&amp;#39;s push notifications on iOS for &amp;quot;heartbeat&amp;quot; services -- to ensure the app can show messages for their user (and many users are asking for tighter integration). On Android, Desktop and #ubuntutouch platforms currently no push notifications are used or needed, also no heartbeat ones.</title>

        <title>We have reports from people for whom delta chat works while signal shows &amp;quot;no internet&amp;quot; ... Various states are throttling traffic all across the planet and you need to have a robust networking layer to provide service. Delta Chat is offline-first, ignores DNS outages, can be combined with Tor or Tails. It is trying to make live easier for people who are already in stress and need a reliable messenging experience. It is project practise to keep the least wealthily connected in focus.</title>

        <title>The 1.42 app releases are rolling into the stores, providing a major security upgrade that was long in the brewing and testing: guaranteed end-to-end encryption, protecting against compromised servers or networks (MITM attacks). The releases also enable multi-device synchronization of pinned/accepted/blocked/muted chat states, a new global gallery for desktop and many bug fixes and little improvements .... #deltachat https://delta.chat/en/2023-11-23-jumbo-42 a checkmark on a green background the shape of a flower or cloud.</title>
