        <title>The problem with asking the experts about something genuinely new is, according to Heinz von Foerster, that they will only explain to you why it can&amp;#39;t work or why it is a bad idea. We had no shortage of such experts in the past years :) However, common objections like &amp;quot;e-mail is too slow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;secure e-mail is not possible&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you can not do a Whatsapp-style interface on top of e-mail&amp;quot; are having an increasingly hard time to be upheld because of the reality of Delta Chat apps working :)</title>

        <title>Delta Chat is an in-between project: often ignored as a messenger by e-mail companies/experts and then ignored by messenger companies/experts because of its use and interoperability with e-mail. As Heinz von Foerster once said: &amp;quot;If you are doing something genuinely new then don&amp;#39;t ask the experts. If you do something that has already been done, then, by all means, ask the experts.&amp;quot; FWIW many experts have verified Delta Chat&amp;#39;s security mechanics https://delta.chat/en/help#security-audits :)</title>

        <title>The &amp;quot;webxdc evolve&amp;quot; project is now official and was just announced from one of our early followers and advisers, @ansuz , but it&amp;#39;s not just a boilerplate announcement! Ansuz dives deep starting from his yearslong cryptpad maintainership history, his early involvement in #webxdc up to the present and future .... Very good reading if you want to understand some.foundational considerations around evolving an end-to-end encrypted, decentralized web app platform ... https://cryptography.dog/blog/announcing-webxdc-evolve/</title>

        <title>Seems the french surveillance practises (Hadopi) identifying people behind IP addresses have been legalized by a top EU court. Fwiw #chatmail servers remove any IP address traces after two days and collect no personal data whatsoever. Maybe it&amp;#39;s time for a french themed chatmail server similar to the de,pl,us ones? https://delta.chat/en/chatmail</title>

        <title>A wild community experiment that can not but fail? Probably but whatever, welcome to **massive multi-device** usage of #deltachat on #chatmail :) it&amp;#39;s an account not shared between your own devices but between all devices who can import the backup file that is currently circulating .... Bringing you an anonymous e2ee encrypted forum without individual user identities, with autodeletion from server after a week .... also adressable wirh e2ee messaging .... #DepartmentOfCrazy A chat list of an anonymous community with 1-member groups: Futurism Politics and news Photography club Developers Foodies Gnu Linux Meme market Anime and manga Cubans</title>

        <title>For those who like to focus on #security an honest question: which other messenger has, like #deltachat in the last 13 months, received and addressed two independent security audits and one security analysis, all three from renowned auditors and researchers?

        <title>Apart from the default #chatmail server advertised on our onboarding page there are at least three other stable open-signup servers whose operators cooperate to ensure stability, see this new page covering background such as funding, trust etc https://delta.chat/en/chatmail</title>

        <title>https://delta.chat is down .... oh no!!!!!.... do you notice any problems with message deliveries? Of course not because DC apps do not depend on this or another single central server :) Anyways, there is a little planned migration ongoing. Well&amp;#39;be back and hugs to our sysadmin/devops folks :)</title>

        <title>Let&amp;#39;s do fun statistics! How many times did you encounter &amp;quot;failed to decrypt&amp;quot; errors in a Delta Chat app in 2024? Maybe add a comment for context if you like. (sidenote: you can send anonymous statistics in advanced settings on Android -- it helps us to assess the state of things and where our efforts are best spent. Thanks!) No failed to decrypt at all Got it but proper multi-device setup fixed it Got it sometimes Get it all the time</title>

        <title>Within #deltachat teams and with many collaborating experts and projects around us, we somewhat stubbornly cling to &amp;quot;working code wins&amp;quot; .... But don&amp;#39;t forget it&amp;#39;s powerful sibling: &amp;quot;maintenable code wins&amp;quot;, especially in the longer term. Our automated testing culture, our use of #rustlang at the heart of things and our usability-first focus all help maintenanbility. We don&amp;#39;t have the treacherous luxury of vc-funding which means we must be a hundred times more economical in our approaches.</title>

        <title>That being said, matrix offers room management like IRC did and fits better, and is developed for corporate environments, whereas delta is focused on private messenging purposes. Evolving delta to have discoverable many-user channels is feasible and there are promising experiments (using good old mailman) but it&amp;#39;s not a primary focus for now. We have a strong focus on stability and improving the base experience to rival WhatsApp ... But we also prepare some surprises for the next release :)</title>

        <title>Messaging transports better be dumb and do the bare minimum to get the job done for end-to-end encrypting apps. Compared to #matrix homeservers #chatmail servers are two orders of magnitude more dumb, consume two orders of magnitude less resources and are blazing fast and don&amp;#39;t require extra (central?!) identity and integration servers. With delta all intelligence, including general purpose https://webxdc.org/apps and protection against compromised networks and servers, lives on the end device.</title>

        <title>&amp;quot;but e-mail !1!!!&amp;quot; Is probably still a number one objection from experts and power users who refuse to fathom that e-mail protocols are a viable option for instant messaging even if it demonstrably works, is fast and secure :) We&amp;#39;d be happy if someone engaged in a proper comparison with xmpp and matrix specs and impls, really the only three messenging protocols deployed and implemented at scale. (Can&amp;#39;t compare that with Signal or WhatsApp which don&amp;#39;t have wire specs!). https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/main/standards.md</title>

        <title>#cryptography news: rpgp, the pure Rust #OpenPGP encryption engine used in all #deltachat apps, got quite some love lately, including a revamp of the main entry point for developers: https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp . You may regard rpgp as an extension of the #rustcrypto effort where a lot of the base code lives and is co-maintained by the wonderful diginifiedquire who also just landed a long awaited sha1-collision detector -- as one of the few people officially allowed to write crypto code :)</title>

        <title>How many people do you know that have lost their messaging history on Whatsapp or Signal, photos etc during mobile phone transitions or breakage or through other shenenigans? With #deltachat you can: - export &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot; to a file and import it on any of the many different devices - or just setup a second device through a QR code scan -- which was happily discovered here after an accidental factory reset https://libranet.de/display/0b6b25a8-2066-0695-ca24-081964494389</title>

        <title>The default setup of #chatmail is for open signups (anyone can get an address) but some operators implement a private signup protocol and that&amp;#39;s fine and easy enough to do because https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail/ is a small machine. Chatmail addresses should be abundant and safe to use for anyone , and cheap to operate with basic skills .... A few thousand chatmail routers might already cover adresses for 10 billion people, with less resource/energy usage than a single VC funded LLM startup :)</title>
