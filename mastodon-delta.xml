        <title>If you like delta chat and know somebody experienced with iOS developments please send them our way, retoots welcome. With all other platforms.we have at least two devs engaged but would like to up our iOS game .... Even advising on a day-per-week or loose pro-bono basis could be helpful but someone who gets their hand dirty would be even better. Remote paid job available. For more background see https://delta.chat/en/2022-12-15-uidevjob and adjacent recent blog posts.</title>

        <title>Do you sometimes hesitate to give out your Whatsapp or Signal address for work, project or private uses respectively? Indeed, it&amp;#39;s not always easy to keep social contexts separated but all #deltachat apps offer proven multi-account support. Just create another :) Tired of platform notification mails and having to go to some weird web mail interface with lots of ads? Just create another account in Delta Chat for platform spam/notifications, and receive it all in a convenient chat app.</title>

        <title>The T-Rex collage from @jarwski is back on our little 700+ accounts community https://testrun.org/ chat-mail instance ... True to the motto we are plotting new rounds of &amp;quot;experiments with the future of email&amp;quot; using a proven project practise : go back to inflection points of history and try fork into a different reality ... None of what is typically believed about email is neccessarily true or unavoidable :) Maybe we have some surprises to show at #ccc congress end this year in hamburg ... A colorful collage picture with a zepelin, a trex dinosaur, projection of planet earth and a retro style sysadmin setup with the caption &quot;test run.org&quot; and sub caption &quot;experimenting with the future of.email&quot;</title>

        <title>We are waiting since 8 days on @fdroidorg to publish a) our disabling of the 1.40.0 release b) our 1.40.1 fdroid release that we did a few hours after users reported crashes. Status is tracked here https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/2639#issuecomment-1692416810 .... We had dozens of users reporting that their fdroid #deltachat install became unusable and we are very sorry about it but also can&amp;#39;t do much else than wait. Don&amp;#39;t deinstall anything, please, but wait for fdroid to publish the update after which things will function again.</title>

        <title>1.40.0 should be delisted soon, but it takes some time between the PR (https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/13586) and app index at https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.b44t.messenger/ update, more for 1.40.1 to be built.</title>

        <title>It seems that the fdroid 1.40 fdroid #deltachat built is broken. Sorry about that. We are trying to mitigate and fix. You can mark this 1.40.0 update to be ignored in the fdroid app. If you already installed the new version then try downgrading. Greetings from #cccamp23</title>

        <title>Many of us are looking forward to #cccamp23 -- the wonderful four-yearly chaos communication camp. We&amp;#39;ll do sessions and talks and will also announce where we are to be found (somewhere around Kommona is the best bet currently) -- we&amp;#39;ll bring a nice new set of stickers and maybe other gimmicks .... big and small Delta Chat and Webxdc stickers sitting on a wooden plate that fits on a club-mate crate</title>

        <title>We left Twitter for good last year but are touched by its downfall in two ways: With &amp;quot;verified chats&amp;quot;, guaranteed e2e encryption safe against active attacks, we use the blue-verified tick icon. KK, we&amp;#39;ll change that soon :) Then, &amp;quot;super apps&amp;quot;: any messenger can eventually support https://webxdc.org and become a super-app. The &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; in webxdc denotes a to-be-evolved world without platforms or mediating billionaires ... here we have an edge, no change needed :) cc @gordon #deltachat Tweet from Gordon brander &quot;Delta Chat is now a superapp&quot; from June 16th, 2022, referencing an announcement on the Delta Chat blog same month.</title>

        <title>From one of our wonderful translators: &amp;quot;I wanted to thank all developers of Deltachat for making such an incredible and simple multi-device supporting app! (Yes, I spent 2 days fresh-installing my double-booted main PC, so I really love all the time the multi-device backup option saved me!) You rock! ðŸ¤©&amp;quot; .... Shout out to our friends at https://n0.computer/ who just published hole punch support https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/releases/tag/iroh-v0.5.1 .... The lib we use for multi device setup in #deltachat #rust core</title>
