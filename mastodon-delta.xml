        <title>For those who like to focus on #security an honest question: which other messenger has, like #deltachat in the last 13 months, received and addressed two independent security audits and one security analysis, all three from renowned auditors and researchers?

        <title>Apart from the default #chatmail server advertised on our onboarding page there are at least three other stable open-signup servers whose operators cooperate to ensure stability, see this new page covering background such as funding, trust etc https://delta.chat/en/chatmail</title>

        <title>https://delta.chat is down .... oh no!!!!!.... do you notice any problems with message deliveries? Of course not because DC apps do not depend on this or another single central server :) Anyways, there is a little planned migration ongoing. Well&amp;#39;be back and hugs to our sysadmin/devops folks :)</title>

        <title>Let&amp;#39;s do fun statistics! How many times did you encounter &amp;quot;failed to decrypt&amp;quot; errors in a Delta Chat app in 2024? Maybe add a comment for context if you like. (sidenote: you can send anonymous statistics in advanced settings on Android -- it helps us to assess the state of things and where our efforts are best spent. Thanks!) No failed to decrypt at all Got it but proper multi-device setup fixed it Got it sometimes Get it all the time</title>

        <title>Within #deltachat teams and with many collaborating experts and projects around us, we somewhat stubbornly cling to &amp;quot;working code wins&amp;quot; .... But don&amp;#39;t forget it&amp;#39;s powerful sibling: &amp;quot;maintenable code wins&amp;quot;, especially in the longer term. Our automated testing culture, our use of #rustlang at the heart of things and our usability-first focus all help maintenanbility. We don&amp;#39;t have the treacherous luxury of vc-funding which means we must be a hundred times more economical in our approaches.</title>

        <title>That being said, matrix offers room management like IRC did and fits better, and is developed for corporate environments, whereas delta is focused on private messenging purposes. Evolving delta to have discoverable many-user channels is feasible and there are promising experiments (using good old mailman) but it&amp;#39;s not a primary focus for now. We have a strong focus on stability and improving the base experience to rival WhatsApp ... But we also prepare some surprises for the next release :)</title>

        <title>Messaging transports better be dumb and do the bare minimum to get the job done for end-to-end encrypting apps. Compared to #matrix homeservers #chatmail servers are two orders of magnitude more dumb, consume two orders of magnitude less resources and are blazing fast and don&amp;#39;t require extra (central?!) identity and integration servers. With delta all intelligence, including general purpose https://webxdc.org/apps and protection against compromised networks and servers, lives on the end device.</title>

        <title>&amp;quot;but e-mail !1!!!&amp;quot; Is probably still a number one objection from experts and power users who refuse to fathom that e-mail protocols are a viable option for instant messaging even if it demonstrably works, is fast and secure :) We&amp;#39;d be happy if someone engaged in a proper comparison with xmpp and matrix specs and impls, really the only three messenging protocols deployed and implemented at scale. (Can&amp;#39;t compare that with Signal or WhatsApp which don&amp;#39;t have wire specs!). https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/main/standards.md</title>

        <title>#cryptography news: rpgp, the pure Rust #OpenPGP encryption engine used in all #deltachat apps, got quite some love lately, including a revamp of the main entry point for developers: https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp . You may regard rpgp as an extension of the #rustcrypto effort where a lot of the base code lives and is co-maintained by the wonderful diginifiedquire who also just landed a long awaited sha1-collision detector -- as one of the few people officially allowed to write crypto code :)</title>

        <title>How many people do you know that have lost their messaging history on Whatsapp or Signal, photos etc during mobile phone transitions or breakage or through other shenenigans? With #deltachat you can: - export &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot; to a file and import it on any of the many different devices - or just setup a second device through a QR code scan -- which was happily discovered here after an accidental factory reset https://libranet.de/display/0b6b25a8-2066-0695-ca24-081964494389</title>

        <title>The last #deltachat 1.44 release round did not only contain a lot of UI/UX milestones but also 20 security fixes based on a deep analysis from Yuanming Song and colleagues of the Applied Cryptography group at ETH Zuerich https://delta.chat/en/2024-03-25-crypto-analysis-securejoin a 3d-picture of a green-checkmark with a chain around it.</title>

        <title>The default setup of #chatmail is for open signups (anyone can get an address) but some operators implement a private signup protocol and that&amp;#39;s fine and easy enough to do because https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail/ is a small machine. Chatmail addresses should be abundant and safe to use for anyone , and cheap to operate with basic skills .... A few thousand chatmail routers might already cover adresses for 10 billion people, with less resource/energy usage than a single VC funded LLM startup :)</title>

        <title>Given the experiences of the last decade it&amp;#39;s healthy to distrust #decentralized tech if - it&amp;#39;s mainly developed by a centralized power structure - the involved technology is very complex - there is coin or VC funding involved #deltachat has 1/100th, if even that, of what other popular messenging projects have in terms of moneys. But our distributed top-notch expertise in UI, crypto, networking tech and our federated collaborative practises across these concerns, try to make up for it ...</title>

        <title>News from the machine room: the pure #rust end-to-end encryption engine, &amp;quot;rpgp&amp;quot;, saw quite some work and a new release in recent weeks and now @hko released a higher level &amp;quot;rpgpie&amp;quot; interface for application developers ( see https://fosstodon.org/@hko/111997998005869515 ) which also powers running the IETF #OpenPGP #interoperability test suite quite successfully .... Delta Chat&amp;#39;s security-audited encryption engine is in fact used from several other projects and in other contexts these days and we are happy about it!</title>
