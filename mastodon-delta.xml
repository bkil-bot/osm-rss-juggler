        <title>Many of us are looking forward to #cccamp23 -- the wonderful four-yearly chaos communication camp. We&amp;#39;ll do sessions and talks and will also announce where we are to be found (somewhere around Kommona is the best bet currently) -- we&amp;#39;ll bring a nice new set of stickers and maybe other gimmicks .... big and small Delta Chat and Webxdc stickers sitting on a wooden plate that fits on a club-mate crate</title>

        <title>We don&amp;#39;t do telemetry but are curious: what kind of e-mail account do you use for Delta Chat? Thanks for any feedback, also in the comments! #deltachat dedicated chat e-mail my regular e-mail a secondary e-mail</title>

        <title>We left Twitter for good last year but are touched by its downfall in two ways: With &amp;quot;verified chats&amp;quot;, guaranteed e2e encryption safe against active attacks, we use the blue-verified tick icon. KK, we&amp;#39;ll change that soon :) Then, &amp;quot;super apps&amp;quot;: any messenger can eventually support https://webxdc.org and become a super-app. The &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; in webxdc denotes a to-be-evolved world without platforms or mediating billionaires ... here we have an edge, no change needed :) cc @gordon #deltachat Tweet from Gordon brander &quot;Delta Chat is now a superapp&quot; from June 16th, 2022, referencing an announcement on the Delta Chat blog same month.</title>

        <title>From one of our wonderful translators: &amp;quot;I wanted to thank all developers of Deltachat for making such an incredible and simple multi-device supporting app! (Yes, I spent 2 days fresh-installing my double-booted main PC, so I really love all the time the multi-device backup option saved me!) You rock! ðŸ¤©&amp;quot; .... Shout out to our friends at https://n0.computer/ who just published hole punch support https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/releases/tag/iroh-v0.5.1 .... The lib we use for multi device setup in #deltachat #rust core</title>

        <title>Delta Chat is not as popular as other messengers but with decentralized messaging it&amp;#39;s not doing so bad, is it? Or which decentral messengers do you know that - have an as strong Usability driven development model, - are available on many platforms and stores, - spearheads unique concepts like https://webxdc.org (web apps shared in a chat) or https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new.html (Verified securely encrypted chats safe against active attacks), - is constantly reaching out for cross-project collab ?</title>

        <title>Delta Chat 1.38 releases: WebXDC apps can now exchange data with other tools and run on other messengers! We&amp;#39;ve implemented a little Calendar and Draw app to showcase the two new APIs and besides have other good news for the nascent privacy-guaranteeing Next-Generation-Internet ... just a &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; button for chat-shared apps with no GDPR or cookie-consents, no coins, no app or account hosting and thus no logins ;) https://delta.chat/en/2023-06-28-webxdc-import-export</title>

        <title>We were very happy when we heard that the XMPP-based https://cheogram.com/ experimentally adopted https://webxdc.org -- so that the same web apps run on Cheogram and Delta Chat. We started communicating with Cheogram&amp;#39;s main dev through matterbridge in a group chat about upcoming webxdc improvements ... #interoperability ftw :) A screenshot of the Android Cheogram messenger apps showing the &quot;2048&quot; and &quot;checklist&quot; apps running inside a cheogram conversation.</title>

        <title>Delta Chat has a pretty wild development model compared to more regular places with VC or Coin or NGO funding. It is partly based on money but also on helping each other out in diverse situations of which there are too many to summarize them, also considering that most countries are in a more or less critical crisis state. This all requires different cooperation practices going far beyond &amp;quot;agile&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;waterfall&amp;quot; dichotomies ... see also our last December UIdev post https://delta.chat/en/2022-12-15-uidevjob</title>

        <title>Earlier this year we got into a surprising and somewhat annoying struggle with Web browser sandboxing failures related to our &amp;quot;web apps shared in a chat&amp;quot; feature. After much background work we released the hardened Delta Chat 1.36 series, also addressing a dedicated fourth independent security audit, and can finally share more of what was going on behind the scenes https://delta.chat/en/2023-05-22-webxdc-security #chromium #deltachat #security #webxdc</title>

        <title>End-to-End encryption is one of the good things we have with the current internet and app ecosystems. But it is under constant threat -- be it from EU&amp;#39;s #chatcontrol, UK&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;online safety bill&amp;quot; or the current renewed &amp;quot;EARN IT&amp;quot; effort in the US: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/earn-it-bill-back-again-seeking-scan-our-messages-and-photos .... anyone of these efforts succeeding would be a dangerous dam break. Let&amp;#39;s collectively make sure all these governmental anti-privacy efforts fail!</title>

        <title>For programmers who are interested in #Golang and/or #bots , you may checkout https://github.com/deltachat-bot/deltabot-cli-go -- The new statically linked deltachat-rpc-server can run on 32/64 bit and be used from any programming language by calling async RPC requests via stdin/stdout to a deltachat-rpc-server running in a subprocess. As released Desktop uses this jsonrpc-API it&amp;#39;s also pretty complete.</title>

        <title>news from the #hyperbridging frontlines of the currently possible ... why not use your emacs/IRC client to connect to a custom DeltaIRCD server where you can load DC accounts as well? or how about accessing the community channel via ` ssh ssh.masfloss.net -p 2023`? If some entity called &amp;quot;chatbot&amp;quot; crosses your paths and you chat with it: be careful, it&amp;#39;s a gpt-ish intelligence also lingering in some channels :) README.md Minimal IRC server which integrates with Delta Chat Â¢ Features * support direct messages / private channels Â« auto-join/leave to same channels as on Delta Chat Â« reconnects with backoff on Delta Chat restarts Â« support multiple users Â« support channel/direct message backlog (messages when you're disconnected from IRC/Delta Chat) * WHOIS, WHO, JOIN, LEAVE, NICK, LIST, ISON, PRIVMSG, MODE, TOPIC, LUSERS, AWAY, KICK, INVITE support Â« support TLS (ssl) * support unix sockets</title>

        <title>We hardly talked about #security audits but there is nothing to hide! #DeltaChat received three security audits in total, covering core networking #encryption as well as SMTP/IMAP protocol and end-to-end encryption, and also including an audit on our recent secure server setup guide: https://delta.chat/en/2023-03-27-third-independent-security-audit</title>

        <title>A little chatgpt-bot for Delta https://github.com/deltachat-bot/chatbot -- you need to instantiate it yourselves on some e-mail address but then it&amp;#39;s very easy to use e.g. for your family or partners via regular Delta Chat chatting. Btw please be warned: we likely will quickly ban accounts who post AI-generated posts to our support forum. If you are curious ask your favorite chat-bot for an argument why posting machine-generated content to a user support forum is unethical ;)</title>

        <title>Five of us were going around Bruxelles the last week, for OFFDEM and server-setup happenings mostly ... and almost none had mobile data and rather relied on random WIFIs .... personally testing our own app&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;offline-first&amp;quot; approach and features for real :) The server-setup workshops generally went very well and some attendees now aim to give sessions themselves in Strasbourg and other places -- and next one is at LAG in Amsterdam this friday ... https://delta.chat/en/2023-01-27-upcoming-mail-server-workshops</title>
