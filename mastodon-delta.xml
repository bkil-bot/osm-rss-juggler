        <title>Do you sometimes hesitate to give out your Whatsapp or Signal address for work, project or private uses respectively? Indeed, it&amp;#39;s not always easy to keep social contexts separated but all #deltachat apps offer proven multi-account support. Just create another :) Tired of platform notification mails and having to go to some weird web mail interface with lots of ads? Just create another account in Delta Chat for platform spam/notifications, and receive it all in a convenient chat app.</title>

        <title>@ravage just contributed a &amp;quot;snap&amp;quot; version of Delta Chat desktop -- https://snapcraft.io/deltachat-desktop -- confirmation that it works (along with the platform you are using) would be welcome.</title>

        <title>The T-Rex collage from @jarwski is back on our little 700+ accounts community https://testrun.org/ chat-mail instance ... True to the motto we are plotting new rounds of &amp;quot;experiments with the future of email&amp;quot; using a proven project practise : go back to inflection points of history and try fork into a different reality ... None of what is typically believed about email is neccessarily true or unavoidable :) Maybe we have some surprises to show at #ccc congress end this year in hamburg ... A colorful collage picture with a zepelin, a trex dinosaur, projection of planet earth and a retro style sysadmin setup with the caption &quot;test run.org&quot; and sub caption &quot;experimenting with the future of.email&quot;</title>

        <title>1.40.1 is available now from inside the @fdroidorg app - this will &amp;quot;unbrick&amp;quot; all devices that had 1.40.0 installed and could not start delta chat, phew! ðŸ¥³</title>

        <title>We are waiting since 8 days on @fdroidorg to publish a) our disabling of the 1.40.0 release b) our 1.40.1 fdroid release that we did a few hours after users reported crashes. Status is tracked here https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/2639#issuecomment-1692416810 .... We had dozens of users reporting that their fdroid #deltachat install became unusable and we are very sorry about it but also can&amp;#39;t do much else than wait. Don&amp;#39;t deinstall anything, please, but wait for fdroid to publish the update after which things will function again.</title>

        <title>1.40.0 should be delisted soon, but it takes some time between the PR (https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/13586) and app index at https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.b44t.messenger/ update, more for 1.40.1 to be built.</title>

        <title>It seems that the fdroid 1.40 fdroid #deltachat built is broken. Sorry about that. We are trying to mitigate and fix. You can mark this 1.40.0 update to be ignored in the fdroid app. If you already installed the new version then try downgrading. Greetings from #cccamp23</title>

        <title>Many of us are looking forward to #cccamp23 -- the wonderful four-yearly chaos communication camp. We&amp;#39;ll do sessions and talks and will also announce where we are to be found (somewhere around Kommona is the best bet currently) -- we&amp;#39;ll bring a nice new set of stickers and maybe other gimmicks .... big and small Delta Chat and Webxdc stickers sitting on a wooden plate that fits on a club-mate crate</title>

        <title>We left Twitter for good last year but are touched by its downfall in two ways: With &amp;quot;verified chats&amp;quot;, guaranteed e2e encryption safe against active attacks, we use the blue-verified tick icon. KK, we&amp;#39;ll change that soon :) Then, &amp;quot;super apps&amp;quot;: any messenger can eventually support https://webxdc.org and become a super-app. The &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; in webxdc denotes a to-be-evolved world without platforms or mediating billionaires ... here we have an edge, no change needed :) cc @gordon #deltachat Tweet from Gordon brander &quot;Delta Chat is now a superapp&quot; from June 16th, 2022, referencing an announcement on the Delta Chat blog same month.</title>

        <title>From one of our wonderful translators: &amp;quot;I wanted to thank all developers of Deltachat for making such an incredible and simple multi-device supporting app! (Yes, I spent 2 days fresh-installing my double-booted main PC, so I really love all the time the multi-device backup option saved me!) You rock! ðŸ¤©&amp;quot; .... Shout out to our friends at https://n0.computer/ who just published hole punch support https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/releases/tag/iroh-v0.5.1 .... The lib we use for multi device setup in #deltachat #rust core</title>

        <title>Delta Chat is not as popular as other messengers but with decentralized messaging it&amp;#39;s not doing so bad, is it? Or which decentral messengers do you know that - have an as strong Usability driven development model, - are available on many platforms and stores, - spearheads unique concepts like https://webxdc.org (web apps shared in a chat) or https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new.html (Verified securely encrypted chats safe against active attacks), - is constantly reaching out for cross-project collab ?</title>

        <title>Delta Chat 1.38 releases: WebXDC apps can now exchange data with other tools and run on other messengers! We&amp;#39;ve implemented a little Calendar and Draw app to showcase the two new APIs and besides have other good news for the nascent privacy-guaranteeing Next-Generation-Internet ... just a &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; button for chat-shared apps with no GDPR or cookie-consents, no coins, no app or account hosting and thus no logins ;) https://delta.chat/en/2023-06-28-webxdc-import-export</title>

        <title>We were very happy when we heard that the XMPP-based https://cheogram.com/ experimentally adopted https://webxdc.org -- so that the same web apps run on Cheogram and Delta Chat. We started communicating with Cheogram&amp;#39;s main dev through matterbridge in a group chat about upcoming webxdc improvements ... #interoperability ftw :) A screenshot of the Android Cheogram messenger apps showing the &quot;2048&quot; and &quot;checklist&quot; apps running inside a cheogram conversation.</title>
