        <title>Shout-out to out to our Communications Working Group (CWG) member (and OSM social media team member) Donitar Orishaba who staffed the OSMF table and participated in the OSMF Working Group panel at @sotm in Nairobi this weekend. Representatives of the different groups shared about what each WG does and how they do it. Working Groups are the main way the OSMF supports OSM---and they are a lot of fun, too. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Learn more about OSM Working Groups: https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Working_Groups</title>

        <title>🎁 HAPPY BIRTHDAY OpenStreetMap! You&amp;#39;ve come a long way in the last 20 years. 😍 Pictured here are our servers freshly racked up in 2011 and a new database server from 2012. This would be our last spinning rust (mechanical hard disk) database server. 36 drive bays! Future database servers used SSD disks.
