        <title>Happy Trans* Day of Visibility! Trans people are mappers, and hackers, and cartographers, and have always been a part of the OpenStreetMap community. The OpenStreetMap project is creating a freely licenced map of the world, based on how things actually are, based on how they act, and appear, not based on what some government says. OSM is trans positive. #OpenStreetMap #OSM #TDoV #TransDayOfVisibility #Trans https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/thumb/2/2f/2019_v1_OSM_Logo_trans.svg/480px-2019_v1_OSM_Logo_trans.svg.png</title>

        <title>The #OpenStreetMap community is massive, and spread out, often by language or country. Different groups use different ways to communicate. There&amp;#39;s an index of all different communication channels, and for each region, which are the methods to use to talk to local mappers there.

        <title>Happy International Women&amp;#39;s Day! #OpenStreetMap is about taking control of our maps from the small, centralized organisations, and giving the maps &amp;amp; the data to the people. Many of these closed mapmakers re-enforce patriarchy, and are dominated by men. With OSM, women can take control of maps! ‚úä ‚ôÄÔ∏è #IWD #IWD2024 #WomensDay #InternationalWomensDay #IntlWomensDay #Feminism #Feminist #OpenStreetMap #OSM</title>

        <title>WIthin OpenStreetMap, many like to use a structured proposal process for new OSM tags. At the end of the day, OSM still allows you to use ‚ÄúAny tags you like‚Äù, and skipping any formal tag voting proposal. Just start mapping with the tags you want! https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Any_tags_you_like #OpenStreetMap</title>
