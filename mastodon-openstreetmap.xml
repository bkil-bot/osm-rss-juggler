        <title>OSM has improved our anti-spam &amp;amp; anti-vandalism methods. We&amp;#39;ve added very generous rate limits to map edits for new account. By reducing vandalism, your map gets better. Life is easier for the rest of the volunteers who fix spam &amp;amp; vandalism. If you&amp;#39;re hitting this limit, then just slow down, take it easy, and continue mapping at a sensible speed. 🙂 Don&amp;#39;t run before you can walk! &amp;lt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Rate_limiting&amp;gt; #OpenStreetMap #OSM</title>

        <title>Do you use the OSM API directly? Make an OSM App? We&amp;#39;re dropping support for certain insecure, legacy authentication methods. If you&amp;#39;re using them in your app, it risks breaking! _(If this is gibberish to you, you&amp;#39;re probably not affected)_ OSM API will remove support for HTTP Basic Auth, &amp;amp; OAuth 1.0a. You&amp;#39;ll have to migrate to the modern OAuth 2.0 feature, which is very well supported. read more: https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/oauth-1-0a-and-http-basic-auth-shutdown/108490 #OpenStreetMap #OSM cc: @osm_tech@osm.town</title>

        <title>OpenStreetMap strives to be open &amp;amp; accessible to as many as possible, and remain independent. In 2020, the OSMF made a commitment that essential communications will always be accessible through an open, preferably self-hosted platform, i.e. accessible through open-source software and open protocols, and do not require an account at a third-party service to access. https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Commitment_to_Open_Communication_Channels #OpenStreetMap #OSM #open #OSMF</title>

        <title>OpenStreetMap data is free, we only ask that you tell people about us in exchange¹. Some site use OSM without attribution, *and* hotlink to OSMF tile servers. 😭 Our data is free, but our servers cost time &amp;amp; money. 🖥 It&amp;#39;s now even easier for you to report naughty sites like that. 📝 They can (eventually) be blocked from freeloading. We hope this will increase visibility of OSM! 👍 🎉 Read more: https://github.com/openstreetmap/tile-attribution/blob/main/README.md #OpenStreetMap #OSM ¹ to simplify the OSM licence req&amp;#39;s.</title>

        <title>DYK? OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) is a UK based organisation, but it only “supports, but does not control” the OpenStreetMap project? 🙂 The OpenStreetMap project is hundreds of thousands of people all over the world, who are liberating maps, and controlling who &amp;amp; what gets mapped, and is larger than one “company limited by guarantee, in England and Wales” The OSMF supports the OSM project, but isn&amp;#39;t the boss. 🙂 #OpenStreetMap #OSMF</title>
