        <title>OpenStreetMap data powers The Washington Post&amp;#39;s story about the size and territory of supermarket chains in USA. OSM is more than a map, we&amp;#39;re a database. Everyone (incl you!) gets the same full access to the data, for free. And if it&amp;#39;s incorrect, you can fix it immediately. We love to see new and surprising uses of OSM data like this. What will you create with OpenStreetMap? https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/grocery-store-owners-map-kroger-albertsons-merger/ #OpenStreetMap #OSM</title>
