        <title>There&amp;#39;s a new map style on OpenStreetMap.org! The Tracestrack Topo map from @tracestrack. It&amp;#39;s a mix of osm-carto and OpenTopoMap. It has many improvements: more tag support (busway, embankment, cuisine, solar plants, aquaculture, pitch, sea, tree etc.), CJK fonts, etc. There is also better internationalisation: country specific road shields, peaks using imperial system in the US, hierarchical place rendering in China, etc. #OpenStreetMap #OSM #gischat #maps A screenshot of OSM.org showing the map layer sector open and showing tracesstrack Topo map selected and that as a map shown</title>

        <title>#OSM&amp;#39;s senior SRE, @Firefishy, tells us that the new server was required because we were running out of capacity in the US. It will be used for renderings/updating the default map style used on https://osm.org. Here are the hardware specs: &amp;lt;https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/piasa.openstreetmap.org/&amp;gt;</title>
