        <title>Another good read via #MDPI: “The Impact of Community Happenings in #OpenStreetMap” (https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/3/164). Effects on mappers who participated in field and remote mapping happenings: newcomers in remote mapping event tended to create lower quality but high quantity new data in places foreign to their home region; newcomers in field mapping happenings updated and enhanced existing local data with high accuracy. Advanced mappers stayed largely unaffected by happenings.</title>

        <title>#OpenStreetMap mappers use different approaches to model various types of intersections. The more the number of roads intersect, the more complex the intersection becomes. In this guide, #Mapbox is presenting different cases of intersections with their best practices and recommendations to follow during mapping: https://labs.mapbox.com/mapping/mapping-for-navigation/modeling-intersections-for-map-navigation/. While you are there, be sure to check the other guides they have.</title>
