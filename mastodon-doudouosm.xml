        <title>Another good read via #MDPI: “The Impact of Community Happenings in #OpenStreetMap” (https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/3/164). Effects on mappers who participated in field and remote mapping happenings: newcomers in remote mapping event tended to create lower quality but high quantity new data in places foreign to their home region; newcomers in field mapping happenings updated and enhanced existing local data with high accuracy. Advanced mappers stayed largely unaffected by happenings.</title>

        <title>#OpenStreetMap mappers use different approaches to model various types of intersections. The more the number of roads intersect, the more complex the intersection becomes. In this guide, #Mapbox is presenting different cases of intersections with their best practices and recommendations to follow during mapping: https://labs.mapbox.com/mapping/mapping-for-navigation/modeling-intersections-for-map-navigation/. While you are there, be sure to check the other guides they have.</title>

        <title>The #Indoor Mapping Landscape in 2021: https://geoawesomeness.com/the-indoor-mapping-landscape-2021-mappedin/. Getting lost indoors might become just as rare as getting lost outdoors. That’s the promise at least, as indoor mapping use cases are popping up regularly as more businesses are realizing the benefits of indoor maps. Is indoor mapping only a business use case? #OpenStreetMap</title>
