        <title>Very good question and I'm confused that BKK is using different colours for their network map diagram and publishing via GTFS. Just checked the date stamp on the BKK diagram and that was last updated on 10th of July 2023 so I would consider that as the latest source of truth. Might be worth reaching out to the BKK team to let them know of this data discrepancy. -Claudius Henrichs</title>
