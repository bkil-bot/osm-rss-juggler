        <title>Raspberry PI: What setups are people using in 2022 lets see some images? I'm thinking of using a PI02 just because there small and are pretty powerful, I have seen https://github.com/designer2k2/warpi which seems a cool project anybody else made one? -wpa3</title>

        <title>Kismet drone on wireless router?: Update: I gave up on trying to get 20y old hardware running with 10y old software... However, I'm still looking for Kismet drone options with a price tag in the lower two digits, i.e. comparable to a Raspberry Pi plus wifi adapter. And while the Pi would definititely be an option, I'd naively assume that hardware specialized in radio communication might be more sensitive, e.g. a wireless router. Can anybody shed some light on whether this assumption is naive or actually true, possibly even with some hardware recommendation? Thanks. -qascnjzd</title>

        <title>Kismet drone on wireless router? (e.g. Linksys WRT54GL): I've just dusted off two Linksys WRT54GL, and noticed some older posts enthusiastic about their radio capabilities. However, for setting up Kismet on this hardware, I only found decade-old instructions and Kismet MIPS binaries from 2004... Has anybody recently set up a WRT54GL as a Kismet drone and could give me some pointers? Thanks. -qascnjzd</title>

        <title>Re: Has anyone run WiGLE inside the windows 11 android subsystem?: you can check scanning permissions in the Android settings, but it's very likely that since you're running inside a virtualized container, windows doesn't provide access to the WiFi radio(s) directly - this could interfere with Window's use of WiFi adapters and would require complicated translation layers. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Has anyone run WiGLE inside the windows 11 android subsystem?: I think the subsystem is hiding the wifi SSIDs. Can't see anything. Or do I need to tweak settings in Windows for this to work? -blackbirdactual</title>

        <title>Re: Rasberry Pi: Kali is now running a kismet version high enough to have the wardriving mode, so i updated everything and gave it a go. Yes thats a big improvement and simple to use change is online here: https://github.com/designer2k2/warpi With this i think its worth to test it on a Zero again. Memory consumption was 450mb for kismet with 13k devices in the logfile. -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: DIY Box Reflector - sick gainz!: Reflector works alright for 5 GHz connections too. Not a huge difference in usability for this test since the test AP is easily reachable without it (~15m distance.) I used two mostly similar adapters so I wouldn't need to re-point the reflector afterwards.
