        <title>Re: GPS accuracy: mostly - we also do cluster detection - points should &quot;snap&quot; not drift in a perfect world. When you se things in weird places, it generally means: 1. they were reported there, improbable though it may be 2. they're PRECISELY POISED between two clusters, or have a very small number of observations. 3. they haven't been seen in a while and were last trilaterated before cluster detection was implemented.Perfect explanation -computerb0y</title>

        <title>Re: Hak5 WiFi Coconut: The coconut appears to have an IPEX (IPX) connector where all the radios come together into a top patch antenna near the fan, so in theory, one could remove that and add an IPX to female SMA bulkhead with an external antenna and be off to the races. It's unknown if there are additional amplifiers in-line with each radio, as a 1:14 splitter will reduce the signal strength by around 12dB in losses with one input antenna. There are also 14 smaller Rf test ports/switches for each radio, however these RF connectors do not appear to be IPX and maybe Murata. Be carefully pulling up the one main antenna off the board, as I accidentally ripped the IPX female connector off the board while attempting to gently pull up the IPX male connector out of the female soldered socket with equal pressure from both sides. An old salty dog friend said it might have been a cold solder joint, as the connector should have popped off the connector before ripping the solder joint, so be careful if you go this method. Some flux and hot air might be able to re-attach it. Now if only dragorn or mkershaw come out with a Win x64 Coconut binary that support a generic GPS/NMEA GPS input, then anyone could Wardrive in style with Windows and 14 radios. I bet it would be the fastest setup for a multi-radio war-driving rig ever.... Hopefully by now we should have some performance reports... anyone? -computerb0y</title>

        <title>Re: Huawei P20 Android 10: If you still can't find the Developer Options or the specific Wi-Fi scan throttling setting, it's possible that your device's manufacturer or ROM might not have included this option in their customized software. In such cases, you might need to check for custom ROMs or firmware that support this feature, but keep in mind that modifying system settings can have risks, and it might void your warranty.

        <title>Re: Increasing accuracy after scan: WiGLE may use some post-processing techniques to filter and clean the data, but it does not typically perform triangulation or signal strength-based location improvement on the data submitted by users. The primary goal of WiGLE is to create a large-scale crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi networks' locations rather than improving the accuracy of individual data points. If you are interested in improving the accuracy of your own scanned data, you can certainly develop a program to apply triangulation or signal strength-based techniques to refine the location of APs. Keep in mind that improving the accuracy of individual data points would require more intensive data processing and may not be part of the standard WiGLE database's approach.

        <title>Re: Custom ROMs for wardriving?: Well, if you're sophisticated enough to install a new OS: first: try the adb trick to remove the throttle on 9; it doesn't work on every model/os. if it works, no need to resort to anything extreme. ( Code: adb shell settings put global wifi_scan_throttle_enabled 0) second: https://lineageos.org/ is pretty niceThanks a! It seems to have worked really well, I'm getting 1 scan every 1-30ms at worst! Considering the human eye takes around 13-400x that to blink, I'd call that a win! It'll absolutely slaughter my battery life, I presume, but I imagine I'll pick up a lot more now! In case you need it for any statistics on who it works/doesn't work for, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S8 SM-G950U running Android 9 (Also, do I need to rerun that command every time I restart? Will security patch updates affect it?) -Wigler-0283819</title>

        <title>Re: ESP32 or ESP8266 Wigle and Lora - Tracker: You can locate individual MAC addresses using the API (without using the whole packet), but we don't provide a networked geolocation service at this time, since we want to avoid knowing where anyone is at any given time. https://api.wigle.net for the API options, you're probably most interested in &quot;network search&quot; we do have an embedded location system for which we publish regular extracts, but it's probably no precise enough to locate stolen property, it's more for providing terrestrial assistance for embedded/non-networked devices in getting a GPS lock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78z5H0rv-wE -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Best Android for WigleWifi: It's a pile of things: Old radios/drivers/OSes might just not tune as fast (and so don't scan as quickly) Driver versions can have a huge impact, making previously slow phones fast and vice versa on upgrade Android 9 throttles WiFi scan speed (and is hard to de-throttle) Android 10 and up also throttle scanning, but if you activate developer mode, you can turn that off. Cheers, -aThanks for that, Arkasha. Besides Android 9 and assuming that the throttle (if present) was disabled, is there any &quot;best&quot; Android version for wardriving? Or would the actual impact of the version itself be mostly minimal, and it is the internal drivers and age of the Wi-Fi module primarily affecting things? -Wigler-0283819</title>

        <title>Custom ROMs for wardriving?: Hi all, I picked up a Samsung Galaxy S8 from eBay for 50 bucks. I picked it up solely for wardriving with the official Wigle app. Unfortunately, after ordering it I've realised that the highest Android version the S8 can support is Pie (9), which I recall has such strict and undisableable throttles on Wi-Fi scans, it's basically impossible to wardrive with. Are there any custom ROMs I could flash which would get along well with Wigle? I've never rooted/jailbroken a phone before, but I'm sure with a few guides from XDA I'll be able to figure it out. Thanks -Wigler-0283819</title>

        <title>ESP32 or ESP8266 Wigle and Lora - Tracker: Hi, and apols - i usually search for previous answers more but... Wigle seems perfect for geolocating, and im after a bike theft tracker - are there any projects around that use 1. low cost low power ESP8266 or ESP32 ($3 and $9) 2. Lora or similar free longish range comms (works well in nz and free for low volume anywhere) 3. Send packet of Wifi strengths to server - which allows stolen tracker locater like functionality ?? If not - can i submit a packet from a scan and get back a geoolocation say anywhere in my country (nz) ?? Thanks and keep up the great work -kiwifirsty</title>
