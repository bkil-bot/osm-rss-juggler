        <title>Re: Car antenna mount position suggestions?: Hi At one moment, I was putting the gps on the roof of my car; I was closing the door on the cable. There is rubber to make joint. So it is not too much compressed. But it is a little anyway. I coulnd't have done that too often without damaging the cable I guess. but this is a USB cable. May be your antenna cable is thinner and would sustain less damaged when taken in the door joint.May be try with a diffrent cable too see how it goes first... but not I never mounted a wifi antenna on the roof. as it is not a very discrete setup Hey! Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I had an idea that it could maybe be done like this. And yes, you're right, it isn't that discrete. I don't want to go around looking like an unmarked police car. haha. I guess I could have a look to see if I can mount them inside near the back window inside the car. Cheers! -T100</title>

        <title>Car antenna mount position suggestions?: Hey guys! So I have gotten the wardriving bug. I've had a lot of fun with it, and I've bought some 7db omni directional antennas which have a magnetic base. The question I had, was where have many of you mounted the antennas? Also, how did you deal with the cables, other than running them through the window? I would like to mount them and have the windows closed, but not have to drill holes in my car. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Cheers! -T100</title>

        <title>Re: Raspberry PI: I'm using this pi (Zero 2 W) and i use GPS2IP on Iphone as GPS. I connect all in WiFi and i use AWUS036NHA card in USB.And how is the Zero 2 W handling that, Im just going to use the internal wifi for now but think a 5g dongle would be better. Almost as easy to use a phone but I have a spare 2W abotu so might as well us it for something fun. -wpa3</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: Excellent info! I've been gauging performance of a few android phones over the past few years. A Galaxy Express 3, Note 3, Note 5, two S7's, S7 Edge, and now adding a Note 20 Ultra to the fleet. What would you happen to be running for scan interval settings on the androids? -Ninemeister</title>

        <title>Kismet drone on wireless router?: Update: I gave up on trying to get 20y old hardware running with 10y old software... However, I'm still looking for Kismet drone options with a price tag in the lower two digits, i.e. comparable to a Raspberry Pi plus wifi adapter. And while the Pi would definititely be an option, I'd naively assume that hardware specialized in radio communication might be more sensitive, e.g. a wireless router. Can anybody shed some light on whether this assumption is naive or actually true, possibly even with some hardware recommendation? Thanks. -qascnjzd</title>

        <title>Kismet drone on wireless router? (e.g. Linksys WRT54GL): I've just dusted off two Linksys WRT54GL, and noticed some older posts enthusiastic about their radio capabilities. However, for setting up Kismet on this hardware, I only found decade-old instructions and Kismet MIPS binaries from 2004... Has anybody recently set up a WRT54GL as a Kismet drone and could give me some pointers? Thanks. -qascnjzd</title>

        <title>Re: Has anyone run WiGLE inside the windows 11 android subsystem?: you can check scanning permissions in the Android settings, but it's very likely that since you're running inside a virtualized container, windows doesn't provide access to the WiFi radio(s) directly - this could interfere with Window's use of WiFi adapters and would require complicated translation layers. -arkasha</title>
