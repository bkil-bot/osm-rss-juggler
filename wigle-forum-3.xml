        <title>Re: Has anyone run WiGLE inside the windows 11 android subsystem?: you can check scanning permissions in the Android settings, but it's very likely that since you're running inside a virtualized container, windows doesn't provide access to the WiFi radio(s) directly - this could interfere with Window's use of WiFi adapters and would require complicated translation layers. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Has anyone run WiGLE inside the windows 11 android subsystem?: I think the subsystem is hiding the wifi SSIDs. Can't see anything. Or do I need to tweak settings in Windows for this to work? -blackbirdactual</title>

        <title>Re: Rasberry Pi: Kali is now running a kismet version high enough to have the wardriving mode, so i updated everything and gave it a go. Yes thats a big improvement and simple to use change is online here: https://github.com/designer2k2/warpi With this i think its worth to test it on a Zero again. Memory consumption was 450mb for kismet with 13k devices in the logfile. -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: DIY Box Reflector - sick gainz!: Reflector works alright for 5 GHz connections too. Not a huge difference in usability for this test since the test AP is easily reachable without it (~15m distance.)

        <title>Redneck Warflying: I know Warflying isn't anything new but this redneck implementation just worked out great. My old LG V30+ has always had pretty poor battery life but that made it an advantage in this case here. Weighing in at just 156 grams the Mavic Air 2 handled it great. The way it's mounted left the downward sensors functional and it can also get a unique camera perspective of the flight. -Johnnokomis</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: The sleep when hopping between channels might not correlate well with the gain of the antenna, the noise within the LNA chain, the sensitivity of the radio, the selectivity of the tuner and its noise rejection characteristics. There is no substitute for predicting how well a given device will perform when scanning given a certain path &amp;amp; mobility choice - just count how many each of them gather. Retrace the exact same path multiple times (at least 3-5) while shuffling the position of the devices within the vehicle and then correlate between them to see repeatability. What might be also interesting to track is how much juice each of those consumes while scanning both in absolute terms (W, to predict heating) and in relative terms (% of battery/hour). By the way, could we perhaps have a button for reporting abuse on every forum? That fits quite well the numbers I've observed on the devices. but it does not directly match as the S4 is a bit slower than the S7, but still gets more wifi... -kurz</title>
