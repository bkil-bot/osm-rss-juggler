        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: The sleep when hopping between channels might not correlate well with the gain of the antenna, the noise within the LNA chain, the sensitivity of the radio, the selectivity of the tuner and its noise rejection characteristics. There is no substitute for predicting how well a given device will perform when scanning given a certain path &amp;amp; mobility choice - just count how many each of them gather. Retrace the exact same path multiple times (at least 3-5) while shuffling the position of the devices within the vehicle and then correlate between them to see repeatability. What might be also interesting to track is how much juice each of those consumes while scanning both in absolute terms (W, to predict heating) and in relative terms (% of battery/hour). By the way, could we perhaps have a button for reporting abuse on every forum? That fits quite well the numbers I've observed on the devices. but it does not directly match as the S4 is a bit slower than the S7, but still gets more wifi... -kurz</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: i was looking at the Wigle app, and this scan time is jumping a bit around, so i took the data from above and looked into that: As every scan result gets the same timestamp, i used now only the unique timestamps. That gives a timestamp for every finished scan. And now plotting this unique timestamps:Basically, the higher the count, the more complete scans it made. The RPI is a bit different, as it reports at the time when it finds something, therefore gets a lot more timestamps. The chart above can also be shown as numbers: total time: 5060s unique S4 timestamps: 973, average intervall: 5.20s unique S7 timestamps: 1319, average intervall: 3.84s unique S20 timestamps: 1500, average intervall: 3.37s unique RPI timestamps: 2313, average intervall: 2.19s That fits quite well the numbers ive observed on the devices. but it does not directly match as the S4 is a bit slower than the S7, but still gets more wifi... -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: Can you post your devices' scan speeds for comparison? My S5/SM-G900T can do a scan in about 3.9s with throttle off. It runs LineageOS 18.1. Internet says its chipset is a Broadcom BCM4354. I think I can explain some of OP's findings. Here are the wifi chipsets as far as I can research: S4 BCM4335 LG G3 BCM4339 S7 Edge BCM4359 Each mfg. probably uses a different antenna setup but maybe you can assume the newer chipsets are better. If you have root &quot;iw&quot; actually works on Android. You can use &quot;iw list&quot; to examine chipset capabilities. &quot;iw dev wlan0 get power_save&quot; and &quot;iw dev wlan0 set power_save off&quot; worked on my device but didn't affect scanning speed. It probably only affects station mode. The vendor's firmware files suggest my phone is meant to use country code &quot;GB&quot; ruleset. &quot;iw reg get&quot; shows &quot;00&quot; which usually means unset/most restrictive and I couldn't change it. -SkywardLark</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: the S20 runs stock Android 11 (One-Ui 3.1) Just developer mode active to turn off the wifi scan throttling. Only the S4 runs LineageOs to have a more current system on it -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: Very cool information. Is the S20 just a stock OS? I run an S7 Edge and an old Core Prime together all the time, and the stuff found by one but not the other is always an interesting thing. -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: yes arkasha this is tricky to do, as the devices idealy are in the same place. Even when the phone is closer to the A pillar or centered in the windscreen it gets different results kurz, the rpi(4) is running kali linux with kismet and 2 usb wifi dongles in monitoring mode (TP-Link Archer T9UH AC1900, ALFA AWUS036NEH). Another comparison, all the RSSI values in a histogram:Both RPI wifi dongles can be seen with the 2 RSSI lines. And it gets the strongest signals by far. The S4 seems to fetch most wifi´s with very low RSSI The script i used to generate the data from above and the plot: https://gist.github.com/designer2k2/417 ... 9b0895e039 -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: Did you use any USB wifi dongle with an external antenna on the Raspberry or only the internal one? I think you could find even more in monitor mode, not sure whether the linked OS image contains it: https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon The RPI is this: https://www.designer2k2.at/de/mods/elek ... ving-setup Found only by RPI: 2662 -kurz</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: This insight is super-valuable! Side-by-side comparisons are really expensive/hard to do (same time, same route, more than 2-3 devices), but it would be great to get a ranking of the &quot;best&quot; net detecting phones. (maybe at a conference or public event where we can get people to travel the same route together?) We're careful not to embed any analytics/tracking stuff in the app so it would require community organization! -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: WiGLE WiFi for Android phone performance comparison: with a s20 now i am surprised by how much it finds, so i made a run with &quot;all the gear&quot; to compare it: about 1 hour driving, all devices behind the windscreen: S4 W: 5783 B: 711 C: 24 S7 W: 4897 B: 1890 C: 104 S20 W: 7420 B: 2684 C: 78 RPI W: 8809 B: 1352 C: 0 Samsung phones run Wigle 2.63 The RPI is this: https://www.designer2k2.at/de/mods/elek ... ving-setup So yes, the S20 is quite a beast for wifi and even more on bluetooth. Celltowers it’s a bit lower than the S7. Looking a bit deeper, how do the individual datasets match? Found by all: 2995 (this wifi´s where in all 4 devices) Found only by S4: 981 Found only by S7: 616 Found only by S20: 2195 Found only by RPI: 2662 The S20 is fetching quite a lot. So far the &quot;best&quot; wigle phone I’ve seen. -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: GPS accuracy: mostly - we also do cluster detection - points should &quot;snap&quot; not drift in a perfect world. When you se things in weird places, it generally means: 1. they were reported there, improbable though it may be 2. they're PRECISELY POISED between two clusters, or have a very small number of observations. 3. they haven't been seen in a while and were last trilaterated before cluster detection was implemented. -arkasha</title>
