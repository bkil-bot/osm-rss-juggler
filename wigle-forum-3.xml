        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: My Pixel 6 has no SIM, and was purchased unlocked, so I don't think it's beholden to Verizon. Any specific setting or model numbers that would be useful to collect? -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: A couple of drives now seeing 'normal' results with the Pixel 6 after setting &quot;Keep screen on&quot; in the app options on the main screen menu. I made the setting change while the P6 was showing 1 WiFi network and it instantly jumped to 11 networks seen. As noted before, it appears you can hit the power button to power off the screen and things remain happy. Very odd, but happy to have a work-around for the issue! -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: Are the numbers from the phones displayed on the dashboard? Or the numbers are after you uploaded them to wigle and they were parsed? Are you uploading the phones with the highest displayed found nets first or randomly uploading whichever phone you grab first?This are the &quot;# in File&quot; numbers from the upload page. So the total found in that given run. Another find from today is that it also kind of works if you plug in power. But not as good as with screen on. The wifi count is ~ same between S20 and P9Pro, Bluetooth is way worse, Cells are same. So something is up with the Radios in the Pixel phones depending on the &quot;Sleep state&quot; i would say -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: I did a mult-hour run today with my Pixel 6 and set the screen config in the WigleNet app to &quot;Keep screen on&quot;. It definitely did better for discovered WiFi than when the screen was allowed to sleep. The upload file is in the Wigle.net queue so we'll see how it compares to several other devices. I als had it in my pocket for several hours at an event, and while the screen was off (as I had hit the power button on the device), we'll have to see how it did based on the app setting saying keep the screen ON. -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: i can confirm now that &quot;screen on&quot; solves the problem. How usable that is, is another topic... Data from a short run, all 3 phones on the dashboard from a car: S10: Wifi: 2250 Cells: 25 Bluetooth: 1054 S20: Wifi: 2542 Cells: 28 Bluetooth: 1204 P9: Wifi: 2737 Cells: 48 Bluetooth: 1175 so the Pixel 9 holds now 1st place in my phone fleet, but only when i can let the screen on. Plot with the data shows how many more scans the P9 makes: p9_screenon.PNGAre the numbers from the phones displayed on the dashboard?

        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: I took a look at the AOSP information at https://source.android.com/docs/securit ... 2024-09-01 and it looks a lot like out of bounds write fixes aplenty in the Quallcomm WLAN code for September. Similar for August patches - https://source.android.com/docs/securit ... 2024-08-01 I'm not smart enough to know if any of that would impact what we are seeing, but maybe someone else has a nose for the news in the of the details. -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel 9 (Pro) its so bad, wow...: Hey @arkasha does this give any leads for a code-solution to the Pixel issues, or do we just need a user advisory to enable “Keep screen on” for best results? -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: Android app error: CSV not processed. Trilaterating...: Not dumb at all! The app only has so much real-estate to show what's going on, so 'unprocessed' just means &quot;waiting for the kittens&quot; generally. It is curious though, watching the Upload/trilateration queue continue to grow here on the website, my waiting files keep moving farther back (was #974, now #986). I was thinking files would hold their location in the queue. The waiting, it's the hardest part -pejacoby</title>

        <title>Re: Android app error: CSV not processed. Trilaterating...: Ok, gotcha. Its just not obvious to some (ie me or Google) that a CSV error on my local device is due to a server backlog. As I said, first time in 10 years seeing it. Sorry for being dumb. Thanks, -thebaldgek</title>

        <title>Re: Android app error: CSV not processed. Trilaterating...: There are about 2300 files in the Trilateralization queue right now. I'm sure the WigleKittens are working furiously to clear things, and that the admins are keeping them well fed along the way. Hopefully it's not the external goobers attacking the site and causing issues again... https://wigle.net/stats#processing -pejacoby</title>
