        <title>Re: Best Android for WigleWifi: It's a moving target, too! Hardware gets better and more versatile, and OS/driver updates can make previously-good or previously-bad devices behave very differently One observation: there's a &quot;sweet spot&quot; beyond which the very size of your local database can slow the device; beware trying to data-hoard on an individual phone, vs. exporting your observations or backing up your individual device SQLite databases to a computer that's faster and more powerful than your phone. Obviously, we think you should upload to WiGLE.net (shameless plug), but if you prefer to keep your data to yourself, you can still do a lot more with it on more powerful computers. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Best Android for WigleWifi: None of what the previous answers suggests matters. Manufacturers build phones in batches, each batch will differ depending on how well the manufacturing machines are calibrated. 2 Samsung S9 phones from 2 different batches will display 2 different results from the antennas and the bluetooth. Another consideration is that all because the phone is a newer version that doesn't mean it will be better at wifi or bluetooth scanning. Tested numerous android phones at Intel, tested 10+ android phones on my own. There is no defacto best android phone for wardriving. -toothpaste</title>

        <title>Re: Pwnagotchi plugin: Using the pwnagotchi is what got me back into messing around with WiFi. I'm currently experimenting with the plugin; it's possible it may only send files with associated location data. I'm not sure yet. This might be why *I* can't get it to work either. I'll bring this up with a few people over the next week and get some feedback. There have been a number of interesting recent developments regarding the Pwnagotchi. https://github.com/DrSchottky/pwnagotchi https://github.com/aluminum-ice/nexmon-pi-zero-2w 1.) Aluminum-Ice has been working with DrSchottky on an update to the nexmon drivers for the raspberry Pi Zero 2W. This will improve the hardware behavior to more closely match what is expected. This work is not finished yet, and a &quot;1.7.0&quot; build is expected to be released int he near future with all of the changes finally rolled into one image (including Waveshare v3 support!). Aluminum-Ice has been doing most of the work, with the good doctor helping with the nexmon update. For the time being, the build that works for me (isn't blind to WiFi) on my Zero 2W is here-includes all he nexmon fixes up until last year: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QBCgTC ... share_link As I only use a Pi Zero 2W for my Pwnagotchi now, this is a big deal. The added speed of the 2W compared to the 1W is immediately noticeable. 2.) There has been a fix posted to reddit related to pwnagotchi locality not being set properly and therefore being limited to the channels available to whatever region the device is set to. It's basically a matter of changing your country/region code in console. See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnagotchi/com ... de_the_us/ There is also active discussion going on in the Unofficial Pwnagotchi discord which is posted on the subreddit. Hope this helps someone since the information seems so scattered. -BPinard</title>

        <title>Re: Kismet drone on wireless router?: Update: I gave up on trying to get 20y old hardware running with 10y old software... penalty kick online However, I'm still looking for Kismet drone options with a price tag in the lower two digits, i.e. comparable to a Raspberry Pi plus wifi adapter. And while the Pi would definititely be an option, I'd naively assume that hardware specialized in radio communication might be more sensitive, e.g. a wireless router. Can anybody shed some light on whether this assumption is naive or actually true, possibly even with some hardware recommendation? Thanks.I think it was the right decision. Radio communication will connect much easier and more stable. -achooibm</title>

        <title>Re: How to delete wigle data collected in certain time frame: Assuming you mean data stored on your local phone/device, you can erase all data on the &quot;Database&quot; item in the 3-horizontal-lines &quot;hamburger&quot; menu. On the &quot;Database&quot; screen scroll to the bottom and you can click &quot;CLEAR DB&quot; to erase all locally-stored data. If you want to be more surgical and really just remove a certain timeframe you would need to export the local sqlite database the app is using, either with android development tools or the &quot;BACKUP DATABASE&quot; button on the &quot;Database&quot; screen. Then use an sqlite database editor to remove the records you no longer want, and then put that file back on your device with android development tools. -bobzilla</title>

        <title>Re: Desktop software to view observations ?: That's not what you asked but here is a solution to your problem. I have made a simple python script that convert a wigle csv file to a kml or gpx file. Then, you can use google maps to visualize the resulting kml file, or any gpx viewer like gpxsee to visualize the resulting gpx file. -zebul666</title>
