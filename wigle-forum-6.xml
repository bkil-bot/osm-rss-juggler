        <title>Re: Massive re-trilateration effort in progress: I noticed that while scanning with the APK in the background, there have been some cases where networks are recorded way far away from their true source, most likely my weird configs but is accountable to the random outliers? I'm sure other travellers with better setups can eventually &quot;correct&quot; it in someway but I wouldn't think a random house has a gas pump. -CabinetVCase</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel update RQ3A.210905.001 breaks GPS: When I started with WiGLE, I had a similar problem with my Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro. Same problem also with the Note 11 Pro. WiGLE stopped working when it was not in the foreground, i.e. on screen. Problem is that Xiaomi has implemented some powersaving measures, one of them being giving background processes none, or little, processing time. I solved that by browing the settings: Privacy_protection-&amp;gt;Special_permissions-&amp;gt;Battery_optimization-&amp;gt;WiGLE_WiFi_Wardriving, and select &quot;Don't optimize&quot; there. This allows the app to stay active in the background. Also check this: long press the 'Wigle WiFi' icon, select 'App info' there, Select 'Batteru saver', and select 'No restrictions' there. Now my WiGLE always runs as it should do. This will probably be so on most Xiaomi phones, and even most phones running the MIUI user interface. -josn</title>

        <title>Re: Massive re-trilateration effort in progress: That's good to hear, for years now I've noticed locations appearing in areas that seemed unlikely (deep in swamps), trilateration is not an easy calculation so it was not too surprising given all the variables in everyone's &quot;measurements&quot;. This will be very nice to see, thank you! -ecramp</title>

        <title>Massive re-trilateration effort in progress: Big changes in network positions are sweeping the globe! For weeks now, we've been cleaning up data that our previous trilateration algorithm had incorrectly judged as a &quot;tie.&quot; The southern hemisphere is complete, and we're working through some of the most densely-observed areas in the northern hemisphere, which will take a while. This will manifest as sharp &quot;bars&quot; working across Europe/Northern Africa and the halves of North/Central America. We're proud of the data improvements we're making in the face of a great increase in mobile access points since we devised our original algorithm, and will continue to improve our system! -a -arkasha</title>
