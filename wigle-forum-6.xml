        <title>Re: DEF CON 32 RFHS World Wide War Drive: can you explain the upload times? Contest uploads must be received between 2024-07-19T12:00:00.000-07:00 and 2024-07-22T00:00:00.000-07:00 to be included in scoring. What time zone is that? And there are 2 timeslots each between midnight and 0700 morning on the 19 and on the 22? -d2k2</title>

        <title>Re: Reminder: Query Limits and responsible use: arkasha wrote: &amp;gt; Hey, apparently folks need to hear this again: every WiGLE user has a daily &amp;gt; query limit associated with their account. &amp;gt; This keeps the service available for everyone without costing &amp;gt; $ALL_THE_MONEY. If you deploy code that REALLY doesn't respect your daily &amp;gt; limit, we'll disable your account. If you try and register multiple of &amp;gt; accounts to circumvent the limit, bad things will also happen. &amp;gt; Also, if you're trying to use WiGLE data for commercial purposes, maybe &amp;gt; contact us and help support the project. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; hugs, the WiGLE team Hello, how can I contact you to support the project and remove the limits? -scottbrand</title>

        <title>Re: Reminder: Query Limits and responsible use: Hey everyone. About the daily use, completely understand and agree. But as an example I created my account few days ago. Like many other, got the limit before researching anything as I tried to familiarize myself with the site. But today I was laser focused, I opened the site, clicked in basic search and put an address, the map showed the address with the daily limit exceeded message. Not criticizing, really, just trying to understand if this is intended or maybe i`m still doing something wrong, just found it weird that i haven`t actually been able to do a single research. Oh and I haven`t created multiple accounts or anything. Anyways keep up the good work, i`m working on setting up an old phone to start collaborating aswell. -fernandocarvalho</title>

        <title>Re: Reminder: Query Limits and responsible use: Wouldn't it make sense, for example, to add a button on the phone to the map to generate wifi points on the map and indicate somewhere the number of available commands before the limit expires? It would make things a lot easier, thanks for a reply. -lukaskicz</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: As this is descending into people who've been abusing the system rolling around like football players hoping to get a penalty kick, I'll be locking this thread. If you contact the admin email address, you may or may not get help, depending on the legitimacy of your circumstances. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: I registered my account last year and verified my email. But I cannot use the service. I tried to use the database just for a couple of minutes but was limited. Now I see Daily Limit. I have never used any bots or other automation but was limited. -xamax</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: Yesterday, I attempted to set up an account and successfully received and clicked on the verification link. However, when I tried to log in today, I encountered issues and didn't receive an email to reset my password. Consequently, I had to register for a new account, but I'm yet again not receiving the verification email. I'm using my Gmail for this, and my internet connection is through a 4G modem with a shared IP address. Could this connectivity setup be causing the problem? -jamers5</title>
