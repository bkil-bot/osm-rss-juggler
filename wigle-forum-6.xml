        <title>Re: Massive re-trilateration effort in progress: That's good to hear, for years now I've noticed locations appearing in areas that seemed unlikely (deep in swamps), trilateration is not an easy calculation so it was not too surprising given all the variables in everyone's &quot;measurements&quot;. This will be very nice to see, thank you! -ecramp</title>

        <title>Massive re-trilateration effort in progress: Big changes in network positions are sweeping the globe! For weeks now, we've been cleaning up data that our previous trilateration algorithm had incorrectly judged as a &quot;tie.&quot; The southern hemisphere is complete, and we're working through some of the most densely-observed areas in the northern hemisphere, which will take a while. This will manifest as sharp &quot;bars&quot; working across Europe/Northern Africa and the halves of North/Central America. We're proud of the data improvements we're making in the face of a great increase in mobile access points since we devised our original algorithm, and will continue to improve our system! -a -arkasha</title>

        <title>Reminder: Query Limits and responsible use: Hey, apparently folks need to hear this again: every WiGLE user has a daily query limit associated with their account. This keeps the service available for everyone without costing $ALL_THE_MONEY. If you deploy code that REALLY doesn't respect your daily limit, we'll disable your account. If you try and register multiple of accounts to circumvent the limit, bad things will also happen. Also, if you're trying to use WiGLE data for commercial purposes, maybe contact us and help support the project. hugs, the WiGLE team -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Pixel update RQ3A.210905.001 breaks GPS: Of course I came here after I installed the update and ran into the issue. ☹️ I also found that I had to turn off the Wi-Fi scan throttling developer option again after the update. I'm happy to try gathering debug data of that would help. -scarhill</title>
