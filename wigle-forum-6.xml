        <title>Email verification changes: Due to extensive abuse, we've had make changes, including switching to an email-verification model on registration. This isn't our preferred solution, recent events have made it necessary. As always, if you have a specific use in mind, reach out to us, and please understand that the EULA applies to every user and exists entirely so that we can continue to make this project work. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: RF Hacker Sanctuary DEF CON 31 World Wide Wardrive: Can we get some sort of clarification or further explanation on how the scoring works? It says that it is based on &quot;coverage&quot;. Can we have more detail on what that means please. My inference is that the data submitted during the contest time frame will be compared with existing data that has already been submitted and our score will be based on how much of a percentage of our data matches to the existing data. Is this correct? -K0R41</title>

        <title>Thanks a Billion!: Last week, WiGLE reached 1 billion WiFi Networks recorded. This is mind-boggling number, and we couldn't have done it without the community - in particular, LuciFerko, who submitted the 1-billionth network. Next up: the 1 billionth network with location data in the project (we're about 5.5m away at the time of writing) -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Goodbye, Roamer: This talk and the year prior were the exact reasons that I started working in the wireless realm. I owe so much to Roamer, and Wigle, I can never express the thank you enough. We butted heads, we drank, we hacked things, and most of all we laughed. I can't watch a football game without hearing his &quot;kind&quot; words. Thanks for the memories!, He did it his way! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rPRIFCJaM -mellendic</title>
