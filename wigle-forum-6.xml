        <title>Re: Email verification changes: I registered my account last year and verified my email. But I cannot use the service. I tried to use the database just for a couple of minutes but was limited. Now I see Daily Limit. I have never used any bots or other automation but was limited. -xamax</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: Yesterday, I attempted to set up an account and successfully received and clicked on the verification link. However, when I tried to log in today, I encountered issues and didn't receive an email to reset my password. Consequently, I had to register for a new account, but I'm yet again not receiving the verification email. I'm using my Gmail for this, and my internet connection is through a 4G modem with a shared IP address. Could this connectivity setup be causing the problem? -jamers5</title>

        <title>Re: Reminder: Query Limits and responsible use: That makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately I am trying to learn how to use the platform and couldn't even understand how to try one query before being told my daily limit expired. Is there a way I could practice without costing anyone? I really want to understand this, but I also see how reasonable it would be that queries would be limited. -Sainere</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: We're not currently requiring older accounts to verify. If the abuse attempts continue, we may revisit that decision, but if we do, we'll provide a clear path for verification. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: Who tf uses throwaway email accounts? This isn't r/confessions or the dating app you're hiding from your significant other. By the way, I don't see it mentioned, is this something that ONLY affects new account registration, or are you sending verification emails to existing accounts as well? -vsa77</title>
