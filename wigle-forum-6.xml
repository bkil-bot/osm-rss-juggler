        <title>Re: On _nomap and _optout: obscurity isn't security, encrypt all the things. And how we do that? for websites, we can buy ssl for encryption. for instance, take a look at the https://nullsclash.net/ and http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-t ... i-fi-sense first link has http while the other one has https....one withtout encrytion and other with encryption. What do we do for encryption on the mobile or pc when sharing things over network? -Rupi-Vi</title>

        <title>Re: Google Pie and Wifi Wardriving: All releases 10 through 13 (so far!) allow de-throttling. If you don't de-throttle on those releases, they'll still work, but they'll only be able to scan twice per-minute. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Google Pie and Wifi Wardriving: It seems to me that the Google pixel 6 running Android 13 is capable of war driving. Even before I Disabled &quot; Wi-Fi scan throttling &quot; in developer settings It seemed to work properly, I have not actually tried war diving yet hopefully I can test it against my working phone sometime in the future -scottthepainter</title>

        <title>Re: Massive re-trilateration effort in progress: I noticed that while scanning with the APK in the background, there have been some cases where networks are recorded way far away from their true source, most likely my weird configs but is accountable to the random outliers? I'm sure other travellers with better setups can eventually &quot;correct&quot; it in someway but I wouldn't think a random house has a gas pump. -CabinetVCase</title>
