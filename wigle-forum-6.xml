        <title>Re: Goodbye, Roamer: This talk and the year prior were the exact reasons that I started working in the wireless realm. I owe so much to Roamer, and Wigle, I can never express the thank you enough. We butted heads, we drank, we hacked things, and most of all we laughed. I can't watch a football game without hearing his &quot;kind&quot; words. Thanks for the memories!, He did it his way! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rPRIFCJaM -mellendic</title>

        <title>Goodbye, Roamer: This week, the wardriving world said farewell to Roamer. He was the founder of the World Wide War Drive and a kind, welcoming, supportive friend to us and to this whole community. We're forever in his debt, and he will be missed. #RIPRoamer -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Google Pie and Wifi Wardriving: All releases 10 through 13 (so far!) allow de-throttling. If you don't de-throttle on those releases, they'll still work, but they'll only be able to scan twice per-minute. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: Google Pie and Wifi Wardriving: It seems to me that the Google pixel 6 running Android 13 is capable of war driving. Even before I Disabled &quot; Wi-Fi scan throttling &quot; in developer settings It seemed to work properly, I have not actually tried war diving yet hopefully I can test it against my working phone sometime in the future -scottthepainter</title>
