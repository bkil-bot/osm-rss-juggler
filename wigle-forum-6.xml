        <title>Re: Email verification changes: Who tf uses throwaway email accounts? This isn't r/confessions or the dating app you're hiding from your significant other. By the way, I don't see it mentioned, is this something that ONLY affects new account registration, or are you sending verification emails to existing accounts as well? -vsa77</title>

        <title>Re: Email verification changes: I've been having real issues with search recently that I'm assuming have been due to the recent abuse. I'm not sure if that's because I made an account before email registration was required or not, but I tried making a new account with a gmail address and I haven't gotten a verification email. -JustJones</title>

        <title>Email verification changes: Due to extensive abuse, we've had make changes, including switching to an email-verification model on registration. This isn't our preferred solution, recent events have made it necessary. As always, if you have a specific use in mind, reach out to us, and please understand that the EULA applies to every user and exists entirely so that we can continue to make this project work. -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: RF Hacker Sanctuary DEF CON 31 World Wide Wardrive: Can we get some sort of clarification or further explanation on how the scoring works? It says that it is based on &quot;coverage&quot;. Can we have more detail on what that means please. My inference is that the data submitted during the contest time frame will be compared with existing data that has already been submitted and our score will be based on how much of a percentage of our data matches to the existing data. Is this correct? -K0R41</title>
