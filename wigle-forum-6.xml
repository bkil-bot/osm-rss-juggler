        <title>Re: 23 years of WiGLE: Thanks to the crearors, maintainers and explainers of wigle, Thanks to everyone making inspiring projects and/or just putting up bulk numbers. I was an occasional, read-only user of this amazing public service until the last year or so where it has quickly become a favorite activity for me and I've been setting and breaking personal goals since then.

        <title>Re: 23 years of WiGLE: I only know of this due to it being covered in a video, and despite not have been here as long as some may have, I still think it's an amazing project nonetheless. -CabinetVCase</title>

        <title>Re: 23 years of WiGLE: Much love &amp;amp; respect to all who created/work on and those who continue to work on this amazing project/love of mine! Such projects are rare, which is a shame, but allows me to appreciate WiGLE even that much more. It's allowed me to dive into an area I was only somewhat familiar with and become much more knowledgeable (and intrigued, as always) THANKS and congrats on 23 years!!! Thanks also for the hard work! tz222zt -TZz222zZT</title>

        <title>Re: 23 years of WiGLE: 19 years here and it's been a blast. Amazing how much the WiFi density has grown in that time. -mark571</title>

        <title>23 years of WiGLE: Somehow this hobby project has lasted for 23 years - a truly epic run. We owe that run in no small part to this amazing community of hobbyists, security researchers, and tireless walkers/runners/drivers/skaters/riders. Thank you for being a part of a delightfully weird and creative community, and for making this project a success - give yourselves a round of applause! Skidoo, -ark and the WiGLE team -arkasha</title>

        <title>Re: DEF CON 32 RFHS World Wide War Drive: Mine are working again too. My failure the other day was 20240722-00444 using Wigle 2.86 on Android, but I resubmitted the file a few days later once the queue numbers were a bit lower and it went through fine. -mrmalkovich</title>

        <title>Re: DEF CON 32 RFHS World Wide War Drive: I also had a failed upload when the Q was very full, first time ever since the age of dinosaurs when I first joined Wigle.net. 20240722-00736 It was successful after resubmitting it later. It was just a single device small run which surprised me when I saw the failure. S24 Ultra with Wigle WiFi 2.86. Upload showed successful on the phone, but showed failed status on wigle.net later. -mark571</title>
